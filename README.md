# Implementation of the paper "A Systematic Evaluation of Generative Models on Tabular Transportation Data"( https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11053 )

This directory contains a Python implementation of value-iteration and state-aggregation experiments
for a Gridworld environment, inspired by the setups used in the paper
**"A Systematic Evaluation of Generative Models on Tabular Transportation Data"**.

The code here is organized to make it easy to reproduce part of the experimental pipeline, in particular
the comparison between exact Value Iteration and an approximate version based on mega-states.

## File structure

- `discrete.py`: implementation of a generic discrete environment in the Gymnasium style (`Env` / `spaces.Discrete`).
- `gridworld.py`: definition of the Gridworld environment (Chapter 4 of Sutton’s RL book), built on top of `DiscreteEnv`.
- `value_iteration.py`:
  - implementation of the Value Iteration algorithm;
  - implementation of the mega-state aggregation algorithm;
  - main script that runs multiple configurations of grid size, epsilon, transition probability, and discount factor,
    saving results into `experiment_results.csv`.
- `experiment_results.csv`: example results file generated by `value_iteration.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (Python 3.12 recommended).
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:
  - `numpy`
  - `gymnasium`

To install the dependencies in a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to reproduce the experiments

1. Generate Value Iteration and state-aggregation results:

   ```bash
   python value_iteration.py
   ```

   This will create (or overwrite) the `experiment_results.csv` file in this directory.

The `experiment_results.csv` file included in this repository was generated on the following machine:

- **CPU model**: AMD EPYC 7453 28-Core Processor  
- **Architecture**: x86_64  
- **Logical cores**: 112  
- **Total RAM**: 1007.71 GB
